                <h2>Urban Perspective</h2>
                <p>Urban areas are areas that are more developed and drugs are
                    more available in the urban areas as compared to rural areas.
                    Some of the most commonly abused prescription drugs in
                    urban areas include;</p>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Central Nervous System Depressants (Benzos/
                            Benzodiazepines)</li>
                        <li>Hallucinogens</li>
                        <li>Heroin (Diamorphine)</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>  

                <p>Although prescription drug abuse affects many Americans,
                    certain populations, such as youth, old adults and women may
                    be at particular risk. Abuse of prescription drugs is highest
                    among the youth adults aged 18 to 25 with 5.9 percent
                    reporting nonmedical use in the past month.

                <img src="images/urban perspective.jpg" alt="abuse">

                <h3>Why do people in Urban areas abuse drugs?</h3>

                <p>The drugs are used in urban areas because;</p>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>they are cheaper and easier to obtain for example, Heroin,
                            Fentanyl and Diamorphine</li>
                        <li>the family history of Addiction, this happens mainly
                            because drug addiction is more common in some families
                            and likely involves an increased risk based on genes</li>
                        <li>Mental health disorder/ depression</li>
                        <li>Peer pressure</li>
                        <li>Lack of family involvement</li>
                        <li>Poverty</li>
                        <li>Trauma</li>
                        <li>Taking highly addictive drugs</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Some youths also tend to take these drugs because they
                    believe that they will have more fun, lose weight, fit in, and
                    study more effectively. On the other hand, some youths take
                    these drugs due to social factors, some of these social factors
                    include; deviant peer relatives, popularity, bullying and
                    associating with gangs.</p>
                
                <p>As compared to other drugs like, cocaine, weed, heroin and
                    alcohol which are among the most commonly used drugs in the
                    word by the youth, Prescription drugs have a very serious risk
                    for a person's health. Opioid abuse can lead to vomiting, mood
                    changes, decrease in ability to think (cognitive function), an
                    even decreased respiratory function, coma and can also lead to
                    death. (https://kidshealth.org)</p>

                <h3>Preventative measures for Prescription drug abuse</h3>
                
                <p>Creating awareness about the side effects and consequences of
                    the addiction, Treatment of the people who are already
                    addicted being provided, avoiding addiction to these drugs and
                    substances, providing moral support and counselling to those
                    that are already addicts, avoiding any kinds of temptations and
                    peer pressure, never stopping or changing a dose without first
                    discussing it with a doctor, avoiding the use of other people's
                    prescriptions and never giving one's personal prescription to
                    others may be some of the best ways we can stop prevent the
                    abuse of these drugs. (https://www.toppr.com),
                    (https://www.optionsbehavioralhealthsystem.com)</p>

                <p>Developing safer medicines, the development of effective, non-
                    addicting pain medications is also a priority to the public health.
                    A growing number of older adults and an increasing number of
                    injured military service members add to the urgency of finding
                    new treatments. Researchers are exploring alternative
                    treatment approaches that target other signaling systems in the
                    body such as the endocannabinoid system which is also
                    involved in pain. More research is also needed to better
                    understand effective chronic pain management, including
                    identifying factors that predispose some patients to substance
                    use disorder and developing measures to prevent the
                    nonmedical use of prescription medicines.
                    (https://www.nida.nih.govt)</p>
                
                <p>Some of these preventive methods such as providing moral
                    support and counselling to those that are already addicted have
                    proved to be very effective. I had a short interview with my
                    Aunt who is a counsellor to youths and according to all that she
                    told me, she proved that counselling and providing moral
                    support to the addicts may be one of the best ways to deal with
                    this issue although according to her it may not be 100%
                    effective but a good 70% of the youths that have been brought
                    to her have fully recovered from these addictions. According to
                    her, Counselling may be the best resort for this issue.</p>

        <h1> Rural Perspective on prescription drug abuse</h1>
        <article>
            <div class="column">
                <p>Many rural areas in the countries haven't yet been able to advance because some 
                   areas are unreachable to the local and government services to treat or to allow
                   to be built for better safety of the environment.</p>

                <p>Rural residents often encounter barriers to healthcare that limit their ability 
                    to obtain the care they need. Access to healthcare implies that healthcare services
                    are available and obtainable in a timely manner. Yet rural residents often 
                    encounter barriers to healthcare access. Even when an adequate supply of healthcare
                    services exists in the community, there are other factors that may impede healthcare
                    access. For instance, to have healthcare access, rural residents must also have:</p>  

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Financial means to pay for services, such as health or dental insurance that is accepted by the provider</li>
                        <li>Means to reach and use services, such as transportation to services that may be located at a distance, and the ability to take paid time off of work to use such services</li>
                        <li>Confidence in their ability to communicate with healthcare providers, particularly if the patient is not fluent in English or has limited health literacy</li>
                        <li>Trust that they can use services without compromising privacy</li>
                        <li>Confidence that they will receive quality care.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>This information is by ruralhealthinfo.org, expound on the point that data has been 
                    checked on by a big national research organisation. Also many show that there are less
                    chances of there being drug misuse in some rural areas but many other countries there 
                    are high rates of them.</p>

                <img src="images/rural perspective.jpg" alt="abuse">

                <h3>prevention</h3>

                <p>Preventing prescription drug abuse in rural areas of countries like Kenya is an important public health concern. Some strategies that have been implemented in Kenya to prevent prescription drug abuse include:</p>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Strengthening the regulation of prescription drugs: In Kenya, the Pharmacy and Poisons Board is responsible for regulating the distribution and sale of prescription drugs. This includes issuing licenses to pharmacies and drug wholesalers, setting standards for the storage and handling of prescription drugs, and monitoring the distribution and sale of controlled substances.</li>
                        <li>Increasing access to addiction treatment: In Kenya, the Ministry of Health operates a number of treatment centers for substance abuse, including prescription drug abuse. These centers provide a range of services, including counseling, support groups, and medication-assisted treatment.</li>
                        <li>Educating the public about the risks of prescription drug abuse: In Kenya, the government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have undertaken efforts to raise awareness about the dangers of prescription drug abuse. This includes providing information about the risks of taking prescription drugs without a prescription, the signs of prescription drug abuse, and the importance of properly storing and disposing of prescription drugs.</li>
                        <li>Promoting the safe disposal of prescription drugs: In Kenya, the Pharmacy and Poisons Board has established a program for the safe disposal of prescription drugs. This program aims to reduce the risk of prescription drugs being misused or diverted to the black market.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p>In comparison to other forms of drug abuse, the dangers of prescription drug abuse can vary. For example, the abuse of some prescription drugs, such as opioids, can be particularly dangerous due to their high potential for overdose and addiction. However, the abuse of other drugs, such as stimulants or hallucinogens, can also have serious consequences. It is important to note that all forms of drug abuse carry risks and can have negative impacts on an individual's health and well-being.
                    A study published in the Journal of Addiction Medicine in 2015 found that the prevalence of prescription drug abuse may be underestimated in the general population due to underreporting in surveys and other forms of self-report data. The authors of the study suggest that alternative methods, such as drug testing, may be needed to accurately assess the prevalence of prescription drug abuse in the general population. Klaine, E., Kranzler, H. R., & Calvert, G. M. (2015). Prescription drug abuse prevalence: Do self-report data underestimate the problem? Journal of Addiction Medicine, 9(6), 431-436. The prevalence of prescription drug abuse may also vary depending on the specific population being studied.
