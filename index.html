            <h3>SOUTH AFRICA</h3>
            <p>In South Africa, data from treatment centres shows that benzodiazepines, followed by
                analgesics, are the class of medicines for which users most often receive treatment. Of those
                whose primary drug of use was either over-the-counter or prescription drugs, 46.4 per cent
                were seeking treatment for the use of benzodiazepine and 44.8 per cent the use of analgesics (Myers et al, 2003) indicating that the non-medical use of prescription drugs is a
                problem.</p>

            <h3>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</h3>
            <p>In the United States, cannabis is the only illicit drug that is more widely used than
                prescription drugs (including analgesics, stimulants, sedatives, and tranquilizers) according
                to the 2009 National Survey on Drugs and Health. In 2009, Vicodin® (a hydrocodone
                product) was the most used substance after alcohol and marijuana among 12th grade
                students (MTF, 2009) and although its use fell significantly in 2010 to 8 per cent it remains
                one of the most widely used illicit drugs among 12th graders.</p>

                <p>When my brother started using prescription opiods, I trusted him, so when he told me he knew what he was taking and that I shouldn't worry, I believed him. i was young back then and I didn't want to break his trust.   
                    RJ's addiction led to car crashes, an arrest, and multiple failed attempts at treatment. He eventually enrolled in the military in an effort to get himself back on track. He served 
                    in Iraq in 2006 and returned home still struggling with his addiction. He was in recovery for six months before his final relapse and the overdose that caused his death. </p>

                <p>I began misusing prescription opioids with friends in high school, seeking a “numbing effect” from the drugs. I quickly became addicted. Throughout high school, I was popular, 
                    played sports, and got good grades, but I experienced anxiety and depression that were heightened by my inability to share my sexual identity. I began using heroin during my 
                    senior year. After a car crash, I was arrested and jailed for driving while impaired and for possession of illegal substances.</p>
