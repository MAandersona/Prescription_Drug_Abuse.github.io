                <h2>youth's perspective</h2>
              
                <p>Young people may abuse prescription drugs for a variety of reasons, including peer pressure, curiosity,
                the desire to fit in or rebel, or the desire to improve academic or athletic performance. They may also have a 
                history of substance abuse or mental health problems, or they may be seeking relief from physical or emotional pain. 
                (Cicero et al., 2020; NIDA, 2019; Larance et al., 2019; Kjellgren et al., 2013)</p>
                
                <p>Youths who abuse prescription drugs can experience a range of health issues, including overdose, 
                addiction, withdrawal, and a higher risk of HIV and other infectious diseases if they inject drugs. 
                They may also experience mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. 
                (Cicero et al., 2020; NIDA, 2019; Larance et al., 2019; Kjellgren et al., 2013)</p>
                
                <p>The most commonly abused prescription drugs by young people are opioids, benzodiazepines, 
                and stimulants for recreational purposes or to enhance academic or work performance. I noted the use of benzodiazepines
                as a serious issue prevalent in countries such as the US, Australia, Canada and Sweden. (Kjellgren et al., 2013; Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, 2020;
                Larance et al., 2019; NCETA, 2019; Cicero et al., 2020; NIDA, 2019). </p>
                
                <p>Young people get acces to these drugs from mainly friends or family members, or they may purchase them from illegal online pharmacies. (Kjellgren et al., 2013; Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, 2020;
                Larance et al., 2019; NCETA, 2019)</p> 
                
                <h2>Older adults perpective</h2>
                <p>Older adults seem to take similar drugs to the youths such as opiods and benzos with the addition of new drugs such as antidepressants and oxycodone. The difference lies in the reasons for abusing prescription medication,
                and their method of ingestion older people take their meds orally. Older adults may abuse prescription drugs for a variety of reasons, including pain management, anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and other health issues. 
                They may also have a history of substance abuse, be seeking relief from emotional distress, or be taking medications that interact with each other in harmful ways. 
                (SAMHSA, 2020; NIDA, 2019; NCETA, 2019; Matsunaga et al., 2014). Which is diffferent from the youths who take drugs recreationally or to fit in.</p>
                
                <p>Older adults obtain prescription drugs through a prescription from a healthcare provider or from friends and family.</p>
                <p>
                
                <h2>An analysis that compares and contrats the cultural perspectives of prescription drug abuse between young and old populations</h2>
                
                <p>Drug Use:</p>
                   <p>Young adults are more likely to abuse prescription drugs such as opioids, benzodiazepines, and stimulants for recreational 
                   purposes or to enhance academic or work performance. They are also more likely to obtain prescription drugs from friends or 
                   family members rather than a healthcare provider. (Compton, Jones, & Baldwin, 2016)</p>

                   <p>Older adults, on the other hand, are more likely to misuse prescription drugs for pain management or 
                   to treat chronic conditions such as arthritis or back pain. They are more likely to obtain prescription drugs 
                   through a healthcare provider, which can lead to a greater risk of addiction and dependence. (Han, Richardson, & Shah, 2015)</p>
                   
                   <p>Difference in Methods of Ingestion:</p>
                      <p>Young adults are more likely to misuse prescription drugs by crushing and snorting them or dissolving them in water and 
                      injecting them, which can increase the risk of overdose and other health problems. (Compton, Jones, & Baldwin, 2016)</p>

                      <p>Older adults are more likely to take prescription drugs orally, but they may also crush or break pills to make them 
                      easier to swallow or to increase their effectiveness. (Han, Richardson, & Shah, 2015)</p>
                      
                  <p>Reasons for Drug Abuse:</p>
                     <p>Young adults may abuse prescription drugs for a variety of reasons, including peer pressure, curiosity, and the desire 
                     to improve academic or work performance. They may also be more likely to have a history of substance abuse and mental health problems. 
                     (Compton, Jones, & Baldwin, 2016)</p>

                     <p>Older adults may abuse prescription drugs to cope with chronic pain or other physical and emotional issues associated with aging, 
                     such as loneliness or depression. They may also be more likely to have a history of chronic illness, multiple medication use, and 
                     limited social support. (Han, Richardson, & Shah, 2015)</p>
                       
                <p>There are a number of measures that have been implemented to prevent prescription drug abuse among the old and young. 
                    These measures may include:</p>

                 <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Education and awareness campaigns: These campaigns aim to educate the public 
                            about the risks of prescription drug abuse and how to properly use and dispose 
                            of prescription drugs. These campaigns may be targeted at specific populations,
                             such as teenagers or individuals with chronic pain.</li>
                         <li>Disposal programs: These programs provide safe and convenient ways for 
                            individuals to dispose of unused or expired prescription drugs, which can help 
                            prevent the misuse of prescription drugs.</li>
                        <li>improving access to addiction treatment services. </li>
                        <li>Prevention strategies for older adults should focus on reducing the risk of addiction and dependence by using non-pharmacological treatments for chronic pain.</li>
                        <li>improving communication between patients and healthcare providers about the risks and benefits of prescription drugs</li>
                    </ul>
                 </p>   

                 <p>National Institute on Drug Abuse. (2021).</p>
                <p>In conclusion,prescription drug abuse varies from age group to age group but not by much. There is some overlap in the types of drugs, methods of ingestion of said drugs, health issues caused by and preventative measures against prescription drug abuse.
                The main difference seems to be why the different groups abuse drugs.</p>
