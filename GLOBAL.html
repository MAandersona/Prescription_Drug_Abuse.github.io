        <h1> Global Perspecties on prescription drug abuse</h1>
        <article>
            <div class="column">
                <h2>Global Perspective</h2>
                <p>Prescription drug abuse refers to the use of prescription medications in a way that is not 
                    intended or recommended by the prescribing healthcare provider. This can include taking 
                    someone else's prescription medication, taking a medication in a different way or at a 
                    higher dose than prescribed, or using a prescription medication for the wrong reason, 
                    such as to get high. (Mayo clinic, 2022).</p>

                <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the non-medical use of prescription drugs 
                    is a significant public health concern in many countries. In a report published in 2014, 
                    the WHO estimates that the non-medical use of prescription drugs accounts for between 3% 
                    and 11% of the global burden of disease and injury. WHO, (2014).</p>
                
                <p>The prevalence of prescription drug abuse varies widely by country and it may be difficult 
                    to accurately estimate due to variations in definitions and reporting. However, 
                    the non-medical use of prescription drugs is a significant public health concern in many 
                    countries.</p>

                <p>In comparison to other forms of drug abuse, the dangers of prescription drug abuse can vary.
                     For example, the abuse of some prescription drugs, such as opioids, can be particularly 
                     dangerous due to their high potential for overdose and addiction. However, the abuse of 
                     other drugs, such as stimulants or hallucinogens, can also have serious consequences.
                      It is important to note that all forms of drug abuse carry risks and can have negative
                       impacts on an individual's health and well-being.</p>
                
                <p>A study published in the Journal of Addiction Medicine in 2015 found that the prevalence of
                     prescription drug abuse may be underestimated in the general population due to 
                     underreporting in surveys and other forms of self-report data. The authors of the 
                     study suggest that alternative methods, such as drug testing, may be needed to accurately
                      assess the prevalence of prescription drug abuse in the general population. Klaine, E., 
                      Kranzler, H. R., & Calvert, G. M. (2015). Prescription drug abuse prevalence: Do 
                      self-report data underestimate the problem? Journal of Addiction Medicine, 9(6), 
                      431-436. The prevalence of prescription drug abuse may also vary depending on the
                       specific population being studied.</p>  
                       
                <p>There are a number of measures that have been implemented to prevent prescription drug abuse. 
                    These measures may include:</p>

                 <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Education and awareness campaigns: These campaigns aim to educate the public 
                            about the risks of prescription drug abuse and how to properly use and dispose 
                            of prescription drugs. These campaigns may be targeted at specific populations,
                             such as teenagers or individuals with chronic pain.</li>
                         <li>Disposal programs: These programs provide safe and convenient ways for 
                            individuals to dispose of unused or expired prescription drugs, which can help 
                            prevent the misuse of prescription drugs.</li>
                        <li>Etc </li>    
                    </ul>
                 </p>   

                 <p>National Institute on Drug Abuse. (2021).</p>

                <p>It is possible that some members of the public may be unaware of the risks and 
                    consequences of prescription drug abuse due to misconceptions about the safety of
                     prescription drugs, limited education about prescription drug abuse, the misuse of 
                     prescription drugs in a social context, and difficulty recognizing the signs of
                      prescription drug abuse.</p>

                <h3>Preventative measures and effects</h3>

                <p>One of the preventive measures of prescription drug abuse that has proven to be effective, is the use of
                   prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs). The use of these PDMPs has proven
                   effective in some states in the United States of America which is known to be one of
                   the countries effected most by drug abuse. They have the highest known population of
                   drug abusers.</p>

                <p>Prescription drug abuse is being handled better than other types of drug abuse because
                   of the multiple types of prevention methods which have proven effective in many
                   countries.</p>

                <p>Prescription drug abuse can lead addiction and overdose this becomes a public health
                   crisis because most prescription drugs abusers move from using prescription drugs to
                   using more hard drugs because the prescription drugs have a limit. Drug abusers have
                   very high chance of death because they could overdose the medication.</p>

                    <h4>Can prescriprion drugs cause drug addiction?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Prescription drugs cause addiction quite easily, and most prescription drug addictions
                         start with the misuse of a prescription that is meant for short-term as-needed use.  
                         Opioids are one of the most commonly abused prescription drugs, and these drugs 
                         produce a euphoric effect. The symptoms of misuse include euphoria, lethargy, 
                         drowsiness, confusion, dizziness, headaches, seizures, nausea, and difficulty
                         breathing.  Some of the commonly abused pain medications include hydrocodone, 
                         oxycodone, codeine, fentanyl, and meperidine. (https://newmaninterventions.com)

                    <h4>What are the effects of prescription drug abuse?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The effects of 
                        prescription drugs are dangerous and result in thousands of overdose deaths every year.
                        Most prescription drug overdose deaths are unintentional and involve the combination
                        of more than one drug. The misuse of prescription 
                        drugs leads to tolerance for the effects of drugs, causing dependency, which leads
                        to developing drug-seeking behavior or addiction. There are numerous effects of 
                        prescription drug abuse, and these are both long-term, and short-term effects. 
                        Most prescription drug users will develop social isolation, and when they become 
                        addicted to the drugs they are using, they will often use these drugs alone.
                        The long-term use of prescription drugs has the potential to result in job loss or 
                        even lead to homelessness.  Prescription drug users will have increasing financial troubles, 
                        legal problems, and struggle with the consequences of risk-taking behavior.(https://newmaninterventions.com)

                    <h4>Can you be addicted to prescription drugs prescribed by a doctor?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes, you can become addicted to prescription drugs prescribed to you by a prescribing 
                        doctor.  The most common prescription drugs people become addicted to are prescription
                         opioids, central nervous system depressants, central nervous system stimulants, and 
                         prescription sedatives.  There is a dangerous risk of addiction and severe health 
                         consequences if these drugs are not taken as directed by a health care professional. 
                         Prescription pain reliever misuse was the second most common form of illicit drug use
                         in the United States in 2018.  It was estimated that around 3.6% of the population 
                         was misusing pain medication is some way. In 2017 an estimated 18 million people in
                         the United States were abusing prescription medication. Despite these drugs being
                         prescribed for medical purposes, millions of Americans become addicted to them. 
                         The high prevalence of prescription drug misuse varies depending on age, gender,
                         and other factors. The ease of access to these drugs is the leading cause of
                         why someone becomes addicted to them.(https://newmaninterventions.com)

                    <h4>How can prescription drug misuse be prevented?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Preventing or stopping nonmedical use of prescription drugs is an important part of 
                        patient care. However, certain patients can benefit from prescription stimulants,
                         sedatives, or opioid pain relievers. Therefore, physicians should balance the 
                         legitimate medical needs of patients with the potential risk for misuse and 
                         related harms. Patients can take steps to ensure that they use prescription 
                         medications appropriately by; following the directions as explained on the label 
                         or by the pharmacist, never stopping or changing a dosing regimen without first 
                         discussing it with the doctor, never using another person's prescription and never 
                         giving their prescription medications to others. More research can also be done inventing
                         effective, non-addicting medications. (https://nida.nih.gov/)

                    <h4>Is There Treatment for Prescription Drug Addiction?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Treatment for opioid addiction includes medications that can help people get control without a high chance of addiction.
                        Buprenorphine treats opiate withdrawal and dependence. Doctors often use it along with the drug naloxone (a combination that can be called Bunavail, Suboxone, or Zubsolv) to prevent relapse.
                        If you've been taking buprenorphine in pill form and your body has gotten rid of all of the drug you were abusing, you might have another form of buprenorphine implanted under your skin. This is called Probuphine. It provides a constant dose of buprenorphine for 6 months. Buprenorphine also comes as a monthly shot called Sublocade.
                        Other drug treatments for opiate withdrawal include methadone and the blood pressure medicine clonidine. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opiates and can prevent a relapse. It can be taken orally (Revia) or as a monthly injection (Vivitrol). 
                        Doctors recommend that people who misuse opioids keep naloxone, a medication that can reverse an overdose. It comes in a shot (Evzio) and a nasal spray (Narcan).
                        Experts believe that “medication-assisted treatment” with methadone, naltrexone, or suboxone and cognitive behavioral therapy is the best treatment for most patients who have an opioid addiction.
                        Counseling is the most common treatment for addiction to CNS depressants or stimulants. You might also need to detoxify (“detox”) your body under a doctor's care. (https://www.webmd.com)
